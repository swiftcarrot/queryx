# What is Queryx?

Queryx is schema-first and type-safe ORM with code generation.

- **Schema First**: Define application models in a queryx schema file, and it can automatically synchronize with the database structure.
- **Type Safe**: Queryx generates friendly and type-safe ORM methods based on the schema, which come with autocomplete support and are free from type-related errors.

This project is heavily inspired by [Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) and [ent](https://entgo.io/). Database schema management is built upon [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/).
